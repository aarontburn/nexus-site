# Nexus: Renderer with React

## Overview
Nexus is built on [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) so modules must follow some of Electron's architectural rules — especially its [Process Model](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/process-model).

Your module will be split in two parts: The **process** and the **renderer**. 
- The renderer is the frontend of your module. It can manipulate the DOM and render your UI, but has **no direct access to the Node.js API**.

You will need to have the process and renderer work together to make a module. The API provided by Nexus makes this simple and easy to understand.

Utilizing [Inter-Process Communication](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/ipc), your process and renderer communicate through message-passing. This is already fully configured and all template repositories have these functions pre-written.

To communicate data from the renderer to the process:

> 1. A user clicks a button in the UI.
> 2. Renderer invokes  `sendToProcess("button-pressed", 1)`
> 3. Process handles this in `handleEvent(eventType, data)`   
>       ↳ `eventType` = `"button-pressed"`   
>       ↳ `data` = `[1]`   
> 4. Process can do something with the number. 

This section focuses on the `Renderer`.


## Structure

While using React, the renderer structure changes a bit.

```
root/
+-- src/
    +-- renderer/
        +-- index.html
        +-- renderer.ts

        +-- react-wrapper/
            +-- node_modules/
            +-- react_module/       // After building your module once
            +-- src/
                +-- App.tsx
                +-- nexus-bridge.ts
                +-- ...

            +-- ...
```

`renderer.ts` no longer handles events itself. Instead, it loads the dev server in development at `http://localhost:5173` or the built HTML in production. All event handling should happen in your React app via **nexus-bridge.ts**.

## Developing with React
During development, your React application is hosted on a development server, located (by default) on `http://localhost:5173/`. If you need to change this, modify `src/renderer/renderer.ts`.

> During production, your React application is bundled into a single `index.html` file located in `react-wrapper/react_module`. This is what gets loaded into Nexus.

To be able to send and listen to events from your process, the `react-wrapper/src/` directory contains `nexus-bridge.ts`. This file contains functions that you can use to listen to events and send events back.

Within your React application, use `addProcessListener` within a `useEffect` to listen to events. The template already has this set up, but you can move this to wherever you need to listen to events. To send data to the process, use `sendToProcess`.

``` typescript
// App.tsx
function App() {
    // ...
    const [sampleSettingOn, setSampleSetting] = useState(false);

    useEffect(() => {
        const listener = addProcessListener((eventType: string, data: any[]) => {
            switch (eventType) {
                case "sample-setting": {
                    setSampleSetting(data[0]);
                    break;
                }
                case "accent-color-changed": {
                    document.documentElement.style.cssText = "--accent-color: " + data[0];
                    break;
                }
                default: {
                    console.log("Uncaught message: " + eventType + " | " + data)
                    break;
                }
            }
        });
        sendToProcess("init");

        // Return cleanup function
        return () => window.removeEventListener("message", listener); 
    }, []);

    // ...
}
```

The way events are handled is very similar to how the process does it. All events are associated with an `eventType` and data that is passed alongside as an array. You can modify this to create custom hooks, but this implementation is functional as well.

Notice how we call `sendToProcess("init")` after we attach the process listener. This is to let the process know that the renderer is ready, and to make sure we don't miss any events sent from the process.

## HMR/Live Reloading
During development, there **is** support for HMR (Hot Module Replacement, or Live Reloading) **from within the `react-wrapper` directory**. Any changes done elsewhere will require a full restart of Nexus.

Use `CTRL + R` will refresh the application and should reflect any changes you've made in the `react-wrapper`.
