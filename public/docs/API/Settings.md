# Nexus: `Setting<T>` API

## Overview

The `Setting<T>` class defines a configurable setting that can be exposed to the user. It encapsulates both the setting’s data and behavior, and supports a fluent (chainable) API for building settings.

The class is designed to chain calls together when building them. For example:
```typescript
export default SampleProcess extends Process {
    public registerSettings(): (Setting<unknown> | string)[] {
        return [
            new BooleanSetting(this)
                .setDefault(false)
                .setName("Sample Toggle Setting")
                .setDescription("An example of a true/false setting.")
                .setAccessID('sample_bool'),
        ];
    }
}
```
This is the recommended format to build your setting. While specific setting implementations might have different required values, **all settings must have a display name (`.setName()`) and a default value (`.setDefault()`)**. If these fields aren't set, the setting will not be registered.

## Prebuilt Settings

### [`BooleanSetting`](./setting_types/BooleanSetting.md)
Capture binary input (true/false, on/off).

### [`ChoiceSetting`](./setting_types/ChoiceSetting.md)
Present the user with a choice of options where they can select a single one.

### [`HexColorSetting`](./setting_types/HexColorSetting.md)
Capture color input as a hex color.

### [`NumberSetting`](./setting_types/NumberSetting.md)
Capture numerical input from the user as a slider or an input box.

### [`StringSetting`](./setting_types/StringSetting.md)
Capture string input from the user.



## Setting Building Functions
These functions are designed to chain off each other.

### `setName(name: string): Setting<T>`
Sets the display name of the setting. This field is **required**. This cannot be reassigned once set.
> **Parameters**  
> `name: string` → The name of the setting.  
> **Returns**  
> The instance of itself.

---

### `setDefault(defaultValue: T): Setting<T>`
Sets the default value of the setting. This field is **required**. This cannot be reassigned once set.
> **Parameters**  
> `defaultValue: T` → The default value of the setting.  
> **Returns**  
> The instance of itself.

---

### `setAccessID(id: string): Setting<T>`
Sets the access ID of the setting. This field is not required but is **highly recommended**. Cannot be reassigned once set.
> **Parameters**  
> `id: string` → The access ID of the setting.  
> **Returns**  
> The instance of itself.

---

### `setDescription(description: string): Setting<T>`
Sets the description of the setting. Cannot be reassigned once set.
> **Parameters**  
> `description: string` → The description of the setting.  
> **Returns**  
> The instance of itself.

---

### `setValidator(inputValidator: (input: any) => Promise<T | null> | T | null): Setting<T>`
Sets an input validator for the setting. This cannot be reassigned once set. For an example of how to use this, visit the [`StringSetting` Usage Information](./setting_types/StringSetting.md#usage-information) for an example.
> **Parameters**  
> `inputValidator: (input: any) => Promise<T | null> | T | null` → An input validator function that checks and sanitizes the input. If it returns null, the value is rejected. This function **can** be async if your setting requires an async call to validate the value.  
> **Returns**  
> The instance of itself.



## Getter/Setter Methods

### `getAccessID(): string`
> **Returns**  
> The access ID of the setting. If the ID isn't set, returns the display name instead.

---

### `getName(): string`
> **Returns**  
> The name of the setting.

---

### `getDescription(): string`
> **Returns**  
> The description of the setting. If the description is not, returns an empty string (`""`).

---

### `getValue(): T`
> **Returns**  
> The value of the setting.

--- 

### `[async] setValue(value: any): Promise<void>`
Sets the value of the setting. `value` is first parsed into `T` before assigning it to the setting. If `value` isn't a valid type of `T` (either by different type or failing the validator's tests), this will not modify the current value. 

This function is async because the validation process can be async.

If this function is called manually within your process, you must do a call to `this.fileManager.writeSettingsToStorage()` to write your updated settings to storage. See the [FileManager](./helpers/FileManager.md) class for more details.

> **Parameters**  
> `value: any` → The value to set the setting to.   
> **Returns**  
> A `Promise` that resolves to `void` when the setting finishes setting the value.   

--- 

### `[async] resetToDefault(): Promise<void>`
Resets the value of the setting back to its default value specified from `.setDefault()`. 

> **Returns**  
> A `Promise` that resolves to `void` when the resetting process finishes.   




## Functions Used Internally (do not use)

### `getID(): string`
Retrieves the ID of the setting. This is only used internally. The ID is randomly generated during each boot of Nexus and should not be used elsewhere.
> **Returns**  
> The temporary ID of the setting.

---

### `setUIComponent(): SettingBox<T>`
This defines the UI of the setting. This is only used internally and should not be called anywhere.

---

### `getUIComponent(): SettingBox<T>`
This is used to get the UI of the setting. This is only used internally and should not be called anywhere.
